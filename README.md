## Why another Visual Shader add-on?
There are already two major Visual Shader add-on solutions. [ShaderV](https://github.com/arkology/ShaderV) is mainly focused on CanvasItem shaders though and [Godot-Visual-Shader-Node-Library](https://github.com/Maujoe/Godot-Visual-Shader-Node-Library) has run stale.

Furthermore, I have plans to work on another add-on (or perhaps a GDExtension) that will utilize the signed distance shapes Shaders for User Interface Design which would make more custom interfaces possible. This idea is heavily inspired by the awesome Unity asset [Shapes by Freya Holm√©r](https://acegikmo.com/shapes/).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Contributing
Contributions of any kind are welcome! Whether it's new nodes, example scenes or an icon for the add-on, all are appreciated. 

## üî¢ Versioning
This add-on is in development for both 3.x and 4.0. There will be a 4.0 branch once I will see that most of the Shapes nodes that are planned are also implemented.
